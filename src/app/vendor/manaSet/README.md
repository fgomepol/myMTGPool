# Mana v1.4.1

## The Magic: the Gathering mana symbol font!

**New:** view the [documentation site](https://andrewgioia.github.io/Mana) to see Mana in action!

Mana is a complete set of Magic: the Gathering mana, tap, and card type symbols as a pictographic font. You can use this font anywhere you want to display mana and tap symbols&mdash;in your MtG app or website, documents, card images, anything!

## Installing

The easiest way to get Mana into your project is to use either the Bower or NPM packages, depending on your package manager:

```shell
$> bower install mana
```

```shell
$> npm install mana-font
```

We've registered `mana` with [Bower](https://bower.io/#getting-started) and 'mana-font' with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). Just install using the above commands in your project and you can edit anything as needed.

You can also download the [zip file](https://github.com/andrewgioia/Mana/archive/master.zip) here at Github and use the font files and CSS files in your project as needed.

## Usage

Each mana symbol has its own font character. Display them in a manner similar to [Keyrune](http://andrewgioia.github.io/Keyrune) using the `<i class="ms ms-g"></i>` element and class syntax. Class name codes are based on textual mana symbol codes (like g for Green or 3 for, well, {3}).

To use Mana, move the web font files to your `/fonts` directory and include the mana.css stylesheet in your `<head>`:

```html
<link href="css/mana.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

**NEW:** you can now include Mana via CDN thanks to the amazing [jsDelivr](http://jsdelivr.com) project! To include the latest version, reference:

```html
<link href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mana-font@latest/css/mana.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

You can also reference mana.min.css for the minified version.

## Editing the Source

Feel free to edit the source files and compile Mana to fit your needs. Currently LESS is supported, with Sass coming soon.

## Using Mana on the Desktop

If you'd like to use Mana as a desktop font (e.g., in a Word document) there are a few steps and things to know. First, to get it loaded on your system just download the [latest zip file](https://github.com/andrewgioia/Mana/archive/master.zip), extract it, and navigate to `Mana-master\fonts`. In there, install the `mana.ttf` font (typically by double clicking it).

Mana uses [private use characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) for the font glyphs so you unfortunately can't normally "type" anything in Word to see the symbols. To do so, open up the [Mana Cheatsheet](http://andrewgioia.github.io/Mana/cheatsheet.html) and copy the symbol you want, then paste it into Word (or whatever software you're using).
